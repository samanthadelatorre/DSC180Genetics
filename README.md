This project is an expoloratory data analysis on data generated from the 1000 Genomes Project. It uses softwares such as plink2, gatk, and bcftools to explore different chromosomes and run PCA on their vcfs. The config file holds env.json where a Docker image can be found. etl.py contains all data processing and visualization. run.py runs project in its entirety. My written report on my results and data generation process can also be found here.
